I'm a DevOps practitioner with experience working across multiple cloud platforms like AWS and DigitalOcean, and building scalable infrastructure using Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker. I enjoy solving real-world problems through automation and continuous improvement. Currently exploring new opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and deepen my expertise in cloud-native technologies. Always eager to learn and open to new challenges.
